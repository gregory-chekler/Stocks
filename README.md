# Stocks
This project is made for fun and does not necessarily correctly predict or make statements about certain companies. The program itself has a variety of functions. It not only predicts stock price and analyzes trends, but it also collects all sorts of data about stocks and companies. It also can create a graph of stock price throughout time. Enjoy!


uses matplotlib, pandas, pandas_datareader, PIL, pickle, and yfinance
